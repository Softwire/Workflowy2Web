# Workflowy2Web

Workflowy2Web is a Chrome extension which can convert a [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/) list representing a content outline for a website into a working prototype of that website in static HTML files. Installing the extension adds a button to the Chrome toolbar which converts the currently-viewed Workflowy list into a zipped folder containing images, stylesheets and html pages making up the prototype site.

## How to get it
Workflowy2Web will be available on the Chrome Web Store in due course - watch this space!

## How to use it
Create your site outline in Workflowy, following some content conventions (see below). Click the button in Chrome and it will create HTML files for each of your page nodes, with divs for the content nodes within each page, zip them up and present them for download. Save and extract the zip, and load the first HTML page in a browser - pow! There's your prototype.

More specifically...
* Sign up to [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/) if you haven't already
* Create a new list node with the title you want for your site
* Use the Content Conventions below to structure your site content under that title node
* Click on the title node, so that Workflowy focuses on it (rather than e.g. its parents)
* Click the button on the toolbar to trigger your prototype download
* Save the zip and extract it, and your prototype is ready to go
* You can apply custom styling by renaming "custom.template.css" to "custom.css" and modifying as required.

## Demo

Give it a try with the demo outline at https://workflowy.com/s/YNC86MzSba! See all the Content Conventions below in action...

## Content Conventions
* Each node is converted into a separate page unless its title is 'Content' or it is beneath a node with that title.
* Nodes titled 'Content' contain the page content of the parent (Page) node.
 * If a node does not have a 'Content' node the notes attached to the page node are used as page content instead.
* Nodes under 'Content' nodes are converted into divs on the page.
* Hashtags in the notes field of each node are converted into CSS classes on the div.
 * Some built-in classes allow easy presentation of common content types.
 * Other classes can be applied and given custom styling.
 * See the Styling section below for more on both of the above.
* The notes field for each div is included on the page but hidden by default. Hit SHIFT-SPACE to show / hide them.
* A set of pages with identical content can be specified by a single node called e.g. [Page1, Page2, Page3] with a child 'Content' node and page contents as normal. The converter will create pages for all the page titles listed in the brackets, and replicate the page contents for each one.
* A page which just shows the content from one of its children can be specified by putting a node called e.g. ##ChildPageName## under its content node.
* You can force any content (nodes and lines of notes) to be ignored by the converter by prefixing it with a tilde character (~).

## Styling

Styles are contained within a "style.css" file and a "custom.css" file. The custom file is left blank for you to add in your own styling to adjust the prototype. The "style.css" file contains a set of built-in styles - some to provide a baseline for the site, and some to provide backdrops and styling for particular types of content.

At the time of writing, the following built-in classes will add backdrop content to your divs. Add the given hashtag to the notes field (Shift-Enter) on the node, and the content mentioned will appear in the div.

| Hashtag | Content |
|---------|---------|
| #text   | a short lorem ipsum quote - actually just an image for now |
| #image  | image placeholder |
| #video  | video player image |
| #quote  | a pull-quote image |
| #line-graph | line graph image |
| #bar-graph | bar graph image |
| #pie-chart | pie chart image |

## For developers
### Running unit tests
Tests are run using [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html). You will need to [install Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) and then use npm in the main directory to install dependencies:

```
npm install
```
You will then be able to launch a single run of the tests from the command line in the main directory:
```
npm test
```
### Manual testing and debugging
Chrome extensions can be loaded in Google Chrome from the source code without having to be packaged:

To debug the code:
* Open Dev Tools
* Open the 'Sources' section
* Select the Content Scripts tab
